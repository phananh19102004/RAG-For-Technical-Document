## RAG (Langchain)
## Project Overview
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using LLM GPT and Qwen2.5 to generate accurate, context-aware answers based on custom knowledge sources.
Instead of relying solely on a pretrained LLM, the system retrieves relevant documents from a vector database and injects them into the prompt to improve factual accuracy and domain-specific reasoning.
