## Live Demo : (https://phananh1910.xyz/)
The Qwen model is not included in the live demo. If you can't ask questions, it probably means the API key has run out of budget. :)
## Project Overview
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using LLM GPT and Qwen2.5 to generate accurate, context-aware answers based on custom knowledge sources.
Instead of relying solely on a pretrained LLM, the system retrieves relevant documents from a vector database and injects them into the prompt to improve factual accuracy and domain-specific reasoning.
